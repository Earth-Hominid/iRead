This project was originally a one page application written in Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project has been refactored using React, and Firebase has been added to store the book librbary.

The CSS is built from the ground up and dynamically adjusts for most screen sizes.

This project is part of **The Odin Project Full Stack [Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library)**
